# project-euler-solutions
Public-domain solutions to selected Project Euler problems. For a complete list of these problems, visit [https://projecteuler.net/archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

The primary goal of this repo is to show how each problem can be solved with self-contained per-problem code and attempts to avoid exposing the similarity of like problems (Project Euler has an option to hide problem tags to encourage people to find solution methods/classes on their own). If so motivated, I may create a secondary repo that groups problems with a common library of generic functions for primes, factorials, etc.

On top of that, this is a great exercise in solving these types of problems, and a great refresher for the languages used (i.e. Rust and C++ for now, more may come later). In some cases, I made some small and incremental optimizations, such as using matrix exponentiation to more efficiently compute Fibonacci sequence terms, for example.
